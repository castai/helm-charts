# Chart notice

This Helm Chart directory is **only a mirror** of the Workload Autoscaler Exporter Helm chart.

The **source of truth** for the chart lives in a different, internal (not publicly disclosed) repository. 
Changes are developed and reviewed there, and then **mirrored back** into this repository on each release.

## Pull requests

You can still open pull requests against files in this directory, but please note:

- Such PRs will be **closed** in this repository.
- The change will be **implemented and merged** in the source repository instead.
- After that, the updated chart will be **released** and **mirrored** here.

If you want a change to land, treat PRs here as a way to propose the diff, but expect the actual merge to happen in the source repository.
